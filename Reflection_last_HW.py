Looking at the solution at week 9 I can see some differences in the code. For the most part I was able to get most of the solutions correct. 
In the sum of digits I didnâ€™t include in the beginning to check if the number was a base of 10. Although I didn't include this, the code does run and has the 
same functionality. The count of occurrences had some different logic as I used a different counting method that keeps the data in sync with the recursion. 
I did mess up the first factorial as it is not recursive and is not the method that was looked for as my math and logic was messed up. Although the other fibonacci 
was right and does match up with the solution. This week was harder than most for me as the recursion was a little confusing. But after working on these problems I 
understand how to approach these problems for the future.
